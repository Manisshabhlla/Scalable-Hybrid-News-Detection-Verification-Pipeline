📌 Overview

The emergence of large language models such as GPT-4 makes it easier than before to create false information, manipulated, and synthetic generated news. This work presents a scalable hybrid pipeline to determine whether news is duplicate, paraphrased, or ai generated. The proposed solution uses two methods for determining this; first, an approximate similarity method to find identical versions of the same piece of news and second, a deep semantic analysis method to identify paraphrases of the original piece of news.

Both solutions are combined together with other features to obtain a high level of precision for the determination of the type of generated news. The method proposed is scalable due to its use of efficient algorithms and architectures.

🏗️ System Architecture
The proposed pipeline consists of six steps:
Data Ingestion → MinHash + LSH → BERT Embeddings → AI Detector → Hybrid Fusion → Gradio UI
Stage	Component	Purpose
1	Data Ingestion & Preprocessing	Load, clean, normalize, tokenize
2	MinHash + LSH	Approximate similarity search (near-linear complexity)
3	Sentence-BERT	Deep semantic analysis for paraphrase detection
4	AI Content Detector	Classify AI-generated vs human-written text
5	Hybrid Decision Fusion	Weighted combination of all signals
6	Gradio Dashboard	Interactive UI with real-time predictions

Hybrid Fusion Formula
P_fake = w1 * P_tfidf  +  w2 * P_bert  +  w3 * S_fake
P_real = w1 * (1 - P_tfidf)  +  w2 * P_bert  +  w3 * S_real

ŷ = argmax(P_fake, P_real)

⚙️ Setup & Installation
Prerequisites

Python 3.8+
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install transformers sentence-transformers scikit-learn \
            pandas numpy fastapi uvicorn gradio datasketch

🚀 Running the Project
1. Train the Model
   python train_model.py
This will perform the preprocessing for your dataset and also train the tf-idf + logistic Regression classifier and save it as a model. 

2. Launch the Gradio Dashboard
   python app.py
It opens an interactive interface for you to enter your own news texts and see how they will be classified in real time along with the distribution of their respective probabilities and comparison of their similarities to each other.

3. Start the API Server
uvicorn main:app --reload
The REST API will be available at http://localhost:8000.
Endpoint:
POST /predict
Body: { "text": "your news article here" }
Response: { "label": "Fake" | "Real", "confidence": 0.97, "signals": {...} }

📊 Results
Evaluated on a dataset of 50,000 – 200,000 news articles (Kaggle + AI-generated).

Metric	Value
True Negatives (Real → Real)	21,413
True Positives (Fake → Fake)	23,481
False Positives	4
False Negatives	0
